# Reactor Defense
## Briefing

The **Stable Reactor Plant** has been identified as the primary target for the enemy's operation. Reactor 1's power regulator has already been destroyed and militia forces have been forced to retreat. The loss of Reactor 2's regulator will result in a critical meltdown and disable power for the whole of Evergreen. Although backup generators exist, they will be unable to entirely compensate, leaving the city missing vital defenses.

## Outcome
The pilots successfully eliminated all enemy units. During the battle, **Lizard** was identified as the carrier of **Venom's** rifle. A burst transmission from an enemy was detected containing this fact. Militia reinforcements arrived to allow the pilots to repair and withdraw to Evergreen.
