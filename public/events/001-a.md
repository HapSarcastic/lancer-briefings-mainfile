# Trapdoor Spider
## Briefing
Evergreen is currently being harrassed by a sniper firing from the east. **MILITIA TEAM S-5** reported at 0713 hrs today a trail in the forest north of **RIVER LANDMARK** that was absent during the previous patrol. As teams have regularly gone missing when venturing into unsurveyed territory, S-5 disengaged and signaled for reinforcement and further instruction. Evidence further suggests that the target is accompanied by both ground and lightcav units, required the fielding of heavycav in this engagement.

Mission success resulting in the sniper's death or retreat will allow Evergreen time to breathe. Cilivian and militia movement will return to normal, allowing for jobs to be completed on time and the militia to respond to immediate threats quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, Evergreen's rate of expansion will increase and civilian morale will greatly improve. If the pilots do not attempt this mission, S-5 will retreat due to a lack of supplies and manpower.

## Outcome
The sniper - designation: VENOM - was successfully eliminated. Half of a squad of humanoid enemies managed to escape. All other targets eliminated. VENOM's rifle was recovered from the wreckage of their mech.
