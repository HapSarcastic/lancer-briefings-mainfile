**WARNING**: this operation series will consist of 5 combat sequences. If you retreat, you will tick the consumption clock by 1 and lose ground. You will not be allowed to Full Repair until you have retreated.

## Outcome
Beggar One fully cascaded into an *Eidolon*, showing his birth, loss of purpose, and fall into despair. Although he was successfully defeated, the life of Lizard was lost in the process. The Lancers confirmed the presence of another before and during the fight. A communications net recovered revealed three additional names: Mendicant Two, Hierophant Three, and Wonder Four. Wonder was confirmed to be Legna, as well as the individual behind the mysterious company that brought them to the planet in the first place.
