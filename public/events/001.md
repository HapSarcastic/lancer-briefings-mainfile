# Option 1
## Protect the Engineers

*"FLAGGED: INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK! LABORERS/SECURITY REQUIRED, CC ALL RESPONSES TO CHIEF ENGINEER CASTOR FIELDING"*

Evergreen's main landing bowl, located 2.48 kilometers southeast of the colony, is out of commission. Flooding from the annual spring rains has opened up sinkholes under the pad an the installation of drainage pumps and futher updates is impossible without addressing repairs first. **Chief Engineer Fielding** has expressed concerns, backed by **Patience's** data, that the engineer team could come under attack from the raiders during their duties. As such, a military escort is required.

# Option 2
## Trapdoor Spider

Evergreen is currently being harrassed by a sniper firing from the east. **Milita team S-5** reported at 0713 hrs today a trail in the forest north of **River Landmark** that was absent during the previous patrol. Due to evidence indicating the hostile may be escorted by or piloting lightcav, S-5 disengaged and signaled for heavycav reinforcement. Although it is unlikely that this represents an immediate and pressing threat, shutting down the sniper attacks will allow the milita time to breathe and maneuver.
