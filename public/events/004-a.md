# Annelida
## Briefing

Not long ago, a scout team breached a previously unidentified hive site containing tens of thousands of Egregorian eggs. Along with these priceless children, discovered caches of old-model weapons and artifacts could provide value to the Hercynian war effort. An Egregorian revivalist named **Bitter** needs an escort into the hive to flag usable equipment and tag viable eggs for recovery. It is more efficient to request your aid than assign rangers to the job.


## Reward
The Egregorian population will be easier to sway to Evergreen's side and, as Terror is the Egregorian representative in the meeting, their words have a considerable impact.

## Outcome
Despite the appearance of Hive Worms, the area was successfully secured. The Egregorian population of Hivehome is grateful and Terror gave a gift of a friend's Molt and Locus.
