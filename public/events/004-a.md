# Death Valley
## Briefing

Dthall is worried about the status of a ranger team topside that was venturing into a heavily occupied area. They haven't checked in yet and she fears the worst, but Command won't sign off on the mission because they view it as a lost cause. Considering you are lancers, you'd certainly have a better chance getting them out of hot water than anybody else.


## Reward
Dthall will make several additional advances and offers during the negotiations, and will more rangers supporting her position.
