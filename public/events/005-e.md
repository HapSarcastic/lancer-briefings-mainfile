# Attic of the World
## Briefing

The Cassander represents a present and overwhelming threat due to its kinetic-kill rod supply and orbital artillery. A solution requires Lancer presence.

Taking over the station will require seizing its central processing unit. Destroy the automated defense system and complete the hack before Beggar One sends reinforcements and implements full firewalls.

## Reward
The Cassander is removed from the playing field.
