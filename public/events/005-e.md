# Attic of the World
## Briefing

The Cassander represents a present and overwhelming threat due to its kinetic-kill rod supply and orbital artillery. A solution requires Lancer presence.

Taking over the station will require seizing its central processing unit. Destroy the automated defense system, the *Wolf-Spider Drone*, and complete the hack before Beggar One sends reinforcements and implements full firewalls.

## Outcome
The Cassander's systems were removed from enemy control and the final kinetic-kill rod was ejected into the ocean by Lizard. A final artillary barrage is possible and the weapons have been synced to Lancer systems.
