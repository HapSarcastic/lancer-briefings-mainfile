# The Horde
## Briefing
Following odd behavior of local subalterns, a distress signal from a local farm was received. The farm is owned by the Chaus family and they are under attack by a swarm of deviant subalterns. The corruption of their Comp/Con software and the presence of another advanced entity was noted.

## Outcome
The pilot **Lizard** was killed in combat. Pilots **Jack** and **Echo** were forced to withdraw following the loss of Echo's mech. No enemy eliminations. The enemy **[The Broadcast]** was seen withdrawing to the east, along with the subaltern horde. Recommendation: return to scout wreckage for additional date.
