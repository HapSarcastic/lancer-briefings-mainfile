# Tonight There's Gonna be a Prison Break
## Briefing

Although there are an incredible number of subaltern forces dispersed throughout Evergreen's territory, use of HUC tunnels may allow for scouting opportunties. As long as care is taken, analysis of the current situation may reveal useful strategic assets.

Update: scouting was done by an HUC ranger squad, revealing the entire civilian and militia population of Evergreen within the Depot District in a make-shift prison. There appears to be a large field hospital set up, as well as a heavily guarded structure near one side. Squad S-5 estimates a population 15,000 in total. It is believe that the CRT and key militia members could prove useful for future operations.

Warning: this operation will tick the consumption clock by 1. This operation can be attempted multiple times, with increasing difficulty.

## Reward
Freeing the CRT could allow for access to the corvet *Contingency White*, which is space-capable. Planning and timing a prison break during the final assault could create a tactical advantage.
